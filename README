Hi,

This is the GitHub repository for MrBayes, a program used for Bayesian
inference of phylogeny.


    Build instructions, very very short version:

    1. Clone the Git repository.
    2. Refer to the document called "INSTALL" for further information.


Currently, we are in the process of moving everything over from
Subversion to Git, and from SourceForge to GitHub.  The code, web
pages and PDF manuals are already available here, but the bug tracking
database and mailing list are still to be processed.  Also, the MrBayes
home page link at http://mrbayes.net/ is still pointing to the old web
pages.

    The new web site is available at

        http://NBISweden.github.io/MrBayes/


Historical releases are tagged with "v3.2.0" (etc.) from release 3.2.0
onwards.  As soon as issue #1 has been resolved, the 'master' branch
should only contain releasable (stable, working) code.  The 'develop'
branch should hopefully, at all times, contain working development
code that at least compiles.  Apart from simple fixes, new development
happens on feature branches off the 'develop' branch, and are merged
back into 'develop' when finished.  This more or less follows the
"git-flow" branching model.  The orphaned 'gh-pages' branch contains the
web site (only).

After release 3.2.6 (November 2015), MrBayes entered "maintenance mode",
and its care has been passed over to NBIS (National Bioinformatics
Infrastructure Sweden, http://nbis.se/).  The original development
team is still involved with the program, but any future releases will
probably be geared more towards bug-fixes rather than addition of new
features.

With kind regards,
    Andreas (Kusalananda) Kähäri
